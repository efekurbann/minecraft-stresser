# Minecraft Stresser & Tester

This project was made for me to stress test my plugins.<br>
Should only be used for testing.<br>
I was using [PureGero's Stresser](https://github.com/PureGero/minecraft-stress-test) before but it does not support velocity nor server transfers.<br>
So I decided to make my own one. It's designed for my needs and may not have everything you need.

# Usage

**Node is required.**

Use of this tool is quite easy.
Simply run `npm start`
